Dr. Octavia L. Merriweather is a Professor of History at the University of Important Prestige, specializing in 20th-century global history with an emphasis on the cultural and political impact of superheroes. Their research examines how popular media reflects and shapes historical narratives, as explored in works like "The Avengers Assemble… and So Does NATO: Superhero Teams and International Relations in the 20th Century," "Superpowered Past: Mapping 20th-Century History Through Marvel’s Global Footprint," and "Spider-Man and Suburbia: The Rise of the Teen Hero in Postwar America." Dr. Thistlewaite’s scholarship is dedicated to uncovering the profound historical significance lurking beneath spandex and capes, proving that even radioactive spider bites can be a lens for understanding postwar societal shifts. When not lecturing on the geopolitical subtext of superhero team-ups, they enjoy debating the Cold War symbolism of alien invasions and advising graduate students on the delicate art of making everything sound more complicated than it really is.
